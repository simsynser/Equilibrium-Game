Causality is simply an ‘idea’ that is induced from every day experience with our environment. For instance, when kicking a ball results in ball movement, a relationship between kicking the ball (cause) and ball movement (effect) is assumed. Nevertheless, the analysis of covariation or correlation alone may lead to misleading conclusions in case the explanatory mechanisms are not understood. Temporal succession is another important property of causal relations. A cause must take place prior to an effect. Moreover, a cause has either a positive or a negative effect. For example, a negative causal relation indicates that the change of a variable in one direction causes the second variable to change in opposite direction. A positive causal relation, however, means that variables change in the same direction. Labeled arrows express such properties of causal relations [Fig. 1.1]. Figure 1.1: Negative causality and positive causality Note that positive causality and negative causality is equivalent to proportional and inversely proportional covariance. Positive causality: Increase in cause C results in increase of effect E. Decrease in cause C results in decrease of effect E. Negative causality: Increase in cause C results in decrease of effect E. Decrease in cause C results in increase of effect E. 1.2 Feedback Non-linearity in systems like the economy or our climate is typically induced by feedback. In a feedback system the effect variable feeds back to the cause, meaning that the “effect” variable loses its “dependent status”. And so, dependent (effect) and independent variable (cause) become chicken and eggs (Richmond and Peterson 2001). In other words, a variable can be both effect and cause at the same time. Feedback is depicted as closed chain of cause and effect [Fig. 1.2]. Figure 1.2: Two examples of closed feedbacks Fig. 1.2, Left: Indeed more births increase the size of a population (flies, bacteria or whatever). The arrow from birth to the population stands for the fact that a larger population will have more births in the future. Fig. 1.2, right: Likewise, higher fatality rates contribute to a diminishing population size. Whereas a smaller population also exhibit a lower number of fatalities. Note that the two feedback loops described in Fig. 1.2 have different functions: Loop “birth – population” self-enforces population growth, while loop “fatalities – population” has a balancing effect. Enforcing loops are also called positive feedback, whereas loops having a balancing function are named negative feedback. Positive feedback is typically associated with undesirable phenomena like rapid population growth (more population -&gt; more births -&gt; more population -&gt; more births …) or thawing of the arctic ice sheet. Nevertheless, positive feedback also increase money stocks on our bank accounts (more money -&gt; more interest -&gt; more money -&gt; more interest …). At the same time, this mechanism also progressively increasing socio-economic inequality as higher money stocks grow much faster than modest savings. Readers who are acquainted with the basic principles of climatic systems may have recognized that the ice sheet example requires more than two feedback variables. A reasonable representation of this system requires at least three variables [Fig. 1.3]. High temperatures cause thawing and shrinking of the arctic ice sheet. The reflectivity of the surface decreases with shrinking snow and ice covered areas. This is due to high reflectivity of white surfaces and low reflectivity of water. Lower reflection of sunrays implies more absorption, which in turn increases arctic temperatures. Figure 1.3: Positive feedback in arctic climate system The more variables involved in a feedback loop, the harder it gets to identify its function (positive or negative, self-enforcing or balancing). Generally, feedback is positive, if a loop consists of causalities with positive polarity only or an even number of negative polarities. Conversely, feedback is negative, if a loop consist of an uneven number of negative causal relations. So far, you have seen some basic positive feedback loops and their functioning. The function of negative loops is to keep a system in balance, meaning that negative loops act to balance out disturbances to a system. For instance, imagine heating a pot of water: the heat tends to raise the temperature of the water, but negative feedback will react by evaporating water, which reduces the temperature (Bardi 2017). Some might even say negative loops pursue a specific objective of keeping the function of a system intact. This is why negative loops are occasionally referred to as goal-seeking loops. One of the most impressive examples is a feedback system that acts to maintain an approximately constant temperature during the most of the Earth’s history. Due to its structure, the Sun’s luminosity increases by about 10% every one billion years (Bardi 2017). Negative feedback is the reason why temperatures remain relatively constant. Figure 1.4: Negative feedback in planetary CO2 cycle The graphical reproduction of this goal-seeking loop reads as follows [Fig. 1.4]: Our sun’s luminosity is growing gradually over geological time scales and increases temperatures on our planet. Higher temperatures trigger an upsurge in silicate rock weathering. This chemical reaction transforms atmospheric CO2 to CO2 bound in rock. Lower CO2 levels in the atmosphere cause cooling. This is only a very brief explanation. In reality, the CO2 cycle involves much more system elements like volcanic processes that emit CO2, the hydrological cycle or magmatism. In essence, however, this negative loop acts like a thermostat of our global environment. If you have a closer look at it, you will see that it would also balance out a damped solar activity. 1.3 Causal Loop Diagrams The graphical representation of causal structures of a system is a prerequisite for communication, further development of ideas and learning. The so-called causal loop diagrams (CLDs) used so far in this lesson are well suited for getting a clearer picture of the most essential system structures. In contrast to other methods of system formalization, like computer code or mathematical equations, CLDs have a strictly qualitative character. CLDs distinguish between the type of causal relations (positive or negative) as well as the different types of feedback (positive/enforcing or negative/balancing/goal-seeking). In case cause and effect are temporally delayed, two parallel lines indicate a delay. [Fig. 1.5] Figure 1.5: Left: Negative feedback, Right: Positive feedback with delay between variable 1 and variable 2 As we have seen in previous examples, the behavior of a system is closely related to its structure (e.g. positive feedback -&gt; exponential growth). The dynamic pattern of system behavior can take the form of growth, decay, or system overshoot etc. Such behavior will show up across all environmental systems as they are similar in structure (Ford 2010). The CLD may be used to graphically depict the system’s structure and to make assumptions about its behavior: Figure 1.6: CLD and behavior of home heating system Figure 1.7: CLD and behavior of pork price dynamics If you are not quite clear about structure and behavior of a system, it is advisable to sketch a CLD on a piece of jotting paper and discuss it with your peers.
